  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>The data required for this app must come from some kind of fitness tracker like a small watch, band or ring. The app is tested for now with Apple Watches. </p>
  
  <h2>Access to Health Kit</h2>
  <p>This App will use your Health Data to show you details about e.g. your workouts. We will not use your Health Data for anything else. Your Health Data will not be sent anywhere. Your Health Data will be accessed locally through Apple Health and will not be stored or cached by the app.</p>
  <p>The selected metrics are either diretly used as bars or used to calutate bars</p>
  <p>Used to calculate time in zone, time moderate exercise and time vigorous exercise are heart rate, birthdate and resting heart rate.</p>

  <h2>Metris and Calculation</h2>
  <h3>Heart Rate Zones</h3>
  <p>The time you spend in heart rate zones 1-5. 
  <p>Moderate is the sum of Heart Rate Zones 1-3. vigorous is Zones 4 and 5. </p>

  <p>As a default Heart rate zones are calculated with 220 - age, to get the max HR.</p>
  <p>If the heart rate measurement is bigger than 90% of max HR this is considered Zone 5</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 90% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 80% this is Zone 4</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 80% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 70% this is Zone 3</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 70% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 60% this is Zone 2</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 60% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 50% this is Zone 1</p>

  <p>It's possible to select additional calulation methods for max HR. These methods currently are:</p>
  <p>208 - (0.7 × age)</p>
  <p>216 - (1.09 × age) bio. female</p>
  <p>206 - (0.88 × age) bio. female</p>
  <p>202 - (0.55 × age) bio. male</p>

  <p>It is also possible to take resting reart rate into the calculation. The formular then uses:</p>
  <p>((Max HR - Resting HR) * Intensity) + Resting HR</p>
  <p>e.g. Zone 5 then would be:</p>
  <p>((180 - 50) * 0.9) + 50</p>
