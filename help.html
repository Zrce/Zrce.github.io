  <h1>Activity Rings Pro - Help</h1>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>The data required for this app must come from some kind of fitness tracker like a small watch, band or ring. The app is tested for now with Apple Watches. </p>
  
  <h2>Access to Health Kit</h2>
  <p>This App will use your Health Data to show you details about e.g. your steps or calories. We will not use your Health Data for anything else. Your Health Data will not be sent anywhere. Your Health Data will be accessed locally through Apple Health and will not be stored or cached by the app.</p>
  <p>The selected metrics are either diretly used as rings or used to calutate rings</p>
  <p>Directy used as rings are the following metrics: calories, exercise, stand, distance cycling, distance swimming, distance walking running, flights climed, steps, time in daylight</p>
  <p>Used to calculate time in zone, time moderate exercise and time vigorous exercise are heart rate and birthdate.</p>

  <h2>Metris and Calculation</h2>
  <h3>Basic Mectics</h3>
  <p>The metrics you know from Apple Training already: calories, exercise and stand. Use this if you are more interested in weekly / monthly rings. </h2>

  <h3>Distance Metrics</h3>
  <p>Track your distances in walking running, cycling and swimming. Metrics are distance walking running, distance cycling, distance swimming</p>
  
  <h3>Heart Rate Zones</h3>
  <p>The time you spend in heart rate zones 1-5. 
  <p>Heart rate zones are calculated for now with 220 - age, to get the max HR. </p>
  <p>If the heart rate measurement is bigger than 90% of max HR this is considered Zone 5</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 90% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 80% this is Zone 4</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 80% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 70% this is Zone 3</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 70% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 60% this is Zone 2</p>
  <p>Heart rate measurement smaller then 60% and heart rate measurement is bigger than 50% this is Zone 1</p>
  <p>Moderate is the sum of Heart Rate Zones 1-3. vigorous is Zones 4 and 5. </p>
