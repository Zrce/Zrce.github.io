<h1>Heart Rate Zones Plus</h1>

  <h2>The App</h2>
 <p>Track your time in heart rate zones and reach your fitness goals</p>

<p>Take your fitness tracking to the next level with Heart Rate Zones Plus – designed for people who want to understand their heart rate zone performance, not just count steps or calories. Whether you're a dedicated athlete, a weekend warrior, or just starting your fitness journey, this app helps you monitor your heart rate zones, set meaningful goals, and visualize your progress in ways that matter.</p>

<p><strong>Key features</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Custom time periods</strong><br>
  Understand your overall time per day, week, month, last 7 days or last 30 days in each heart rate zone.</li>

  <li><strong>Workout to zone attribution</strong><br>
  Ever wondered which workouts actually contributed to time in Zone 4 or Zone 5? With the smart breakdowns, you don’t just see your total time in heart rate zones—you see exactly which workouts fueled those stats. This lets you answer questions like:
    <ul>
      <li>Does swimming really push me into higher zones?</li>
      <li>How much time have I spent in Zone 2 this week?</li>
    </ul>
  Visualize the impact of each session in intuitive progress bars, color-coded by zone.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Multiple zone calculation methods</strong><br>
  Not all hearts are the same, and neither are their training zones. Choose from a variety of scientifically-backed methods to calculate your maximum heart rate like:
    <ul>
      <li>220 – age</li>
      <li>208 – 0.7 × age</li>
      <li>Gender-specific formulas:
        <ul>
          <li>216 – 1.09 × age (bio. female)</li>
          <li>202 – 0.55 × age (bio. male)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  Decide if you want to include resting heart rate into the zone calculation. You can also manually override your max heart rate and resting heart rate, giving you the power to personalize your training.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Set personal time goals for any zone</strong><br>
  Motivation thrives with targets. With customizable goals, you can decide how many minutes you'd like to spend in each zone over a selected time period. Track your progress with sleek, animated bars that make your data easy to read and satisfying to follow.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Workout breakdown</strong><br>
  Also check a detailed overview of your most recent workouts:
    <ul>
      <li>Distribution of time across all 5 zones</li>
      <li>Sport type icons (running, swimming, walking, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  It’s more than a log—it’s a dashboard of performance.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Dark and light mode support</strong><br>
  Whether you prefer a sleek dark mode for evening reviews or a crisp light mode during the day, the app respects your visual preferences. It integrates seamlessly with your system-wide appearance settings or lets you choose manually.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this app?</strong><br>
This isn’t just another fitness tracker. It’s a focused, intuitive app built to help you understand your cardiovascular training through heart rate zone analytics. It's designed for people who train with intention—and want their data to reflect that.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy</strong><br>
Your health data stays on your device. We use Apple HealthKit to access heart rate and activity data with your permission—and never store or share it externally.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Runners, Cyclists, Rowers, and Swimmers</li>
